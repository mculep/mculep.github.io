            <h1> Aloha! </h1>
         

            <p>I was born and raised on the island of Oahu, Hawaii. My first moved to California was back in 2000. I lived in California for 10 years and 
          moved back to Hawaii 2010. I recently moved back to California 2018, and now pursing learning how to code. I learned very little HTML and CSS
          way back in 2003 when all we had was books and some resources online, but nothing like what we have today. I look forward to learning as much as I can
          and meeting all the people that share the same interest.</p>
